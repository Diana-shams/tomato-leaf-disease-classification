# tomato-leaf-disease-classification
Deep learning models (CNN, VGG16, VGG19) for tomato leaf disease classification using the Tomato Leaf dataset from Kaggle.

This repository contains deep learning experiments for classifying tomato leaf diseases using the [Tomato Leaf Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf).  
We implemented and compared **three models** in the same notebook:

- ✅ Custom CNN  
- ✅ VGG16 (transfer learning)  
- ✅ VGG19 (transfer learning)  

## Dataset
The dataset is available on Kaggle: [Tomato Leaf Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf).  
Please download it and place it inside a `data/` directory before running the notebook.

## Results
| Model   | Accuracy |
|---------|----------|
| CNN     | 94.27%      |
| VGG16   | 87.45%      |
| VGG19   | 85.73%      |
